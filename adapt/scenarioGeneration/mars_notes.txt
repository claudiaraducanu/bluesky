In order to download weather data from the ECMWF, the MARS interface is used. A
complete description of the MARS interface can be found here 
[https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+MARS]. Alternatively the web
interface (although limited) can be used 
[https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/tigge/levtype=sfc/type=cf/]. Alternativly,
the web interface can be used to generate the MARS request.

An example that uses the MARS interface to access the data can be found in the 
'mars.py' file. As a prerequisite it requires the ECMWF API client library and 
a user account on the ECMWF website (a free account can be created). 

After setup, simply run the python script to start the download. Note, the 
request will be put in a queue and might take a while to start. The MARS 
progress can also be tracked using their web-api after loggin in
[http://apps.ecmwf.int/mars-activity/].
